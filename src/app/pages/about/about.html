        My Dream Career

      <div class="w-full md:w-3/4 py-10 text-white font-light text-justify">
        I am working towards <b>Cybersecurity</b> in my career path. Starting by
        understanding the basics and hopefully I'll be able to step into this
        field. Right now I'm honing my skills in full-stack development, and I
        think that will help me have an edge in understanding heavily as to what
        happens in the back-end of cybersecurity.

      <div class="w-full md:w-3/4 py-10 text-white font-light text-justify">
        Currently, I'm thinking of creating projects that will eventually help
        me upskill myself when it comes to various types of development. One of
        these projects are this website! Practicing my front-end skills will
        help me be more flexible in the field.

        Hobbies!

      <div class="w-full md:w-3/4 py-10 text-white font-light text-justify">
        I enjoy various out-door activities! And racquet sports like Badminton
        and Tennis! They've been my pass-time and healthy approach in life
        whenever I want to go out and exercise! I also play quite a few games
        that range from different genres such as MMO/RPG (Elden Ring, Monster
        Hunter Series), RTS (Starcraft, Age of Empires 4), and FPS (Apex,
        Valorant, CSGO/CS2)
